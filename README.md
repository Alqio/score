# Score board 
This is a software for game scores. Register, log in, and add the game.  Then you using an automatically generated hash you can add scores as you wish (so the hash needs to be integrated in the game). Anyone can view the scores. 

You can see the live application here: https://gmscoreboard.herokuapp.com/ Note that it takes a while to load the games as it's running on free Heroku dyno
